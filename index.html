          <p>
            I currently work as a Manager/Data evaluator. I have been working as
            a Manager at a cleaning company for about 3 years now. In this role
            I have spearheaded the creation of our website that has since
            garnerd long time clients. I also help with day to day operations
            including client relations,scheduling, and bookkeeping. When I am
            not working I love to spend time with loved ones, bake, and care for
            my animals which consists of two dogs, six cats, seven hens, two
            roosters, four ducks, two geese and five sheep!
