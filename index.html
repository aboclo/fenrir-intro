          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            I currently work as a Manager/Data evaluator. I have been working as
            a Manager at a cleaning company for about 3 years now. In this role
            I have spearheaded the creation of our website that has since
            garnerd long time clients. I also help with day to day operations
            including client relations,scheduling, and bookkeeping. When I am
            not working I love to spend time with loved ones, bake, and care for
            my animals which consists of two dogs, six cats, six hens, two
            roosters, three ducks, and five sheep!
